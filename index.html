				<p>Hey there and welcome to my website! I built this website from scratch back in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and have continued to update it throughout the years. My name is Jordan Junaidi and I'm a student at the University of California, San Diego, where I study computer science. I'm originally from the Sacramento area and graduated from Vista Del Lago High School in 2024.</p>

				<p class="language">Python</p>
				<p>Python is one of the main languages that I use. I enjoy using it due to its simplicity and I will most likely be creating a majority of my future programs using this language.</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="language">C++</p>
				<p>C++ is another one of the main languages that I am able to use. Now, I do not use it as often as Python, but in the past, I have used it to create several programs.</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="language">HTML and CSS</p>
				<p>Another language that I can use. It is certainly not my specialty, but I am proficient enough in it to be able to create a simple website like this one.</p>
